# Vegetable-CNN-Image-Classification
A deep learning project for classifying vegetables using two different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures.
# Description
This project focuses on classifying images of vegetables into predefined categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Two separate CNN models were implemented to explore the impact of input image resolutions:

  1. Model 1: Designed for images resized to 31x31 resolution.
  2. Model 2: Designed for images resized to 128x128 resolution.
     
The project aims to compare the performance of these models and evaluate the influence of input image size on classification accuracy.
# Dataset
The dataset contains images of various vegetables, such as:

  1. Tomato
  2. Cucumber
  3. Potato
  4. Onion
  5. Carrot

Each image is labeled with its corresponding vegetable class.
# Model Architectures
Experimented with different input shapes, kernel sizes, maxpooling, dropout layers, batch normalization and expotnential decay.
Evaluated results with graph and CNN error %
